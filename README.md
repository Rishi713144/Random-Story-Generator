# Random Story Generator

Welcome to the **Random Story Generator**! This project is a fun and interactive program that creates random stories based on user input and pre-defined templates. Whether you're looking to spark your creativity, entertain yourself, or just enjoy some random storytelling, this tool is perfect for you.

## Features

- **User Interaction:** Enter your own words (like names, objects, places, etc.) to personalize the stories.
- **Randomization:** Each story is generated randomly, so you'll rarely get the same story twice.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple prompts and clear instructions make it accessible for users of all ages.
- **Extendable:** Easily add more templates or story elements to expand the generator.

## How It Works

1. The program presents you with prompts to fill in words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).
2. These words are inserted into a story template.
3. A unique and often hilarious story is generated for you to read and enjoy!
